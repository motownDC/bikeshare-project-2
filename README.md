# My Udacity Bikeshare Project

These files include the code I wrote for my Udacity Ptyhon coding project

## Scope

Create script to analyze bikeshare data from

* _Chicago_
* _New York City_
* _Washington, DC_

## Running the Program

* I used Anaconda's Powershell prompt to run the files
* Inputing **python bikeshare__3.py** in the Powershell prompt ran the scripts
* You will be prompted to pick a city to retrieve data from

## Notes

* Bikeshare data provided by Udacity
* CSV files not included in my github upload
* For some reason, could not get scripts to run in Git Bash which is why I used Powershell
